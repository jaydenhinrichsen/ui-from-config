# ui-from-config
Exploring how UI could be determined by config

In this simple example, the frontend application has no knowledge of the structure or component heirarchy. 
The frontend receives some config data, reads it, loads the required components, and renders them according to the data provided.

Obviously this is an extremely simple and contrived example at first glance, but I encourage you to explore the code in more detail. 
I believe the underlying idea/pattern could be expanded and scaled into much larger applications.
